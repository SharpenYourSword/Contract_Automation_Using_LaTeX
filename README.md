# Contract Automation Using LaTeX

This repository describes how lawyers can use LaTeX (a free, sophisticated document preparation system) to create dynamic contract templates that include fill-in-the-blank form fields, automatic numbering and re-numbering of nested clauses, and an easy system for toggling particular clauses on and off or selecting between alternative versions of clauses. This workflow generates  well-formatted PDF files that are easy to share with colleagues, clients, and counterparties.

Included here is a sample template, `exampleNDA.tex`, a sample output PDF based on that template, `exampleNDA.pdf`, and a copy of an overview document explaining the features that appear in the template, `Contract_Automation_Using_LaTeX.pdf`.

Technically, this is not a fork of an existing repository. However, this repository is indebted to the [Legal_Markdown](https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown) repository, which implements very similar functionality, using YAML and Ruby rather than LaTeX, and served as an inspiration and a procedural model for the approach outlined here.
